# CNN on Fashion MNIST

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Files
- `CNN_on_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/CNN_on_Fashion_MNIST.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd CNN_on_Fashion_MNIST
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CNN_on_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the CNN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at a low resolution of 28x28 pixels.

## Model
The CNN model consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional layers
- Max Pooling layers
- Fully Connected (Dense) layers

## Results
The notebook includes the training process and evaluation metrics, including accuracy and loss plots.
